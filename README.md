### Introduction

A collection of [my Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/TimothyGuo) solutions for <a href="https://www.codewars.com">Codewars</a> katas.

Most katas offer both a longer, descriptive solution and a shorter, more concise one. In my opinion, a longer, descriptive solution is preferable unless a concise one-liner is easily understandable for your entire team.

### Disclaimer

- Codewarriors are strongly encouraged not to look at my solutions to Kata until you have completed it yourselves or at least took the time to think about your own approaches

* Codewarriors should not submit my solutions as their own

- I will not be accepting contributions of any form to this repo

* Creating a repository like this is discouraged by Codewars

### Vocabulary

- Kata: is an algorithm you have to solve in any programming language you desire

- Kyu: is a digit that determines kata difficulty level as well as the user rank on the platform

### Purpose

Practicing katas could help you to improve your algorithmic thinking. It could also help at interviews being more confident and learning a few tricks of your preferred language.

### Tips

1.  Katas has `tags` that could help you in advance to know what to use.
    For example you could solve this kata using regular expressions.

2)  Katas could have some issues that goes beyond your implementation. If you're stuck check the `Issues`.
    Just click where it says `1 Issue Reported` above the `Instructions`.

3.  Finally check the `discussions` in case the Instructions aren't really clear.
    Click on the `Discuss` button under the `Sample Tests`.

4)  After you submit your final solution check the Solutions to learn from other alternatives. If you don't understand them you can leave a comment or check the discussions of each one. Try to learn from these solutions and improve your current one or create a Short Solution of your own.

5.  If you check my solutions the "Long Solution" maybe is longer than the "Short Solution" but is more readable.

6)  If you want to check what solution is faster use [jsPerf](https://jsperf.com) or [JSBench](https://jsbench.me)
