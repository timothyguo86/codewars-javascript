# [One line task: Square a number Without \*, + or Math.pow()](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a9d8cfb5084d79178000150)

Your objective is simple: In fewer than 40 characters (and with a few restrictions), write a function that returns the
square of a number passed in. This number may be anywhere between -32,768 and 32,768, and may include decimals (you will
however absolutely _not_ have to worry about a square being >= 2^53).

In the case that a number is a decimal, after squaring it, round it to the nearest whole number. The `Math` class, along
with `.toFixed()` is tested for (you can't pass with it), but not disabled, so feel free to use it if that makes it
easier before you start minifying your solution. Similarly, the `*` and the `+` operators are not allowed, but not
disabled in the hopes that this may make it slightly easier for some warriors. External libraries and `eval()` are
disabled.

Examples:

```
sq(3.0) => 9
sq(14) => 196
sq(14.4) => 207
sq(-999.999) => 999998
```

Note: The <40 character limit includes the function itself. Luckily, the function's name is `sq`. The reference solution
is 36 characters. I have no doubt some of you will beat that handily. Have fun and good luck! :)
