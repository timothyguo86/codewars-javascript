# [Pull your words together, man!](https://www.codewars.com/kata/54fdadc8762e2e51e400032c)

Your friend Robbie has successfully created an AI that is capable of communicating in English!

Robbie's almost done with the project, however the machine's output isn't working as expected. Here's a sample of a
sentence that it outputs:

    ["this","is","a","sentence"]

Every time that it tries to say a sentence, instead of formatting it in normal English orthography, it just outputs a
list of words.

Robbie has pulled multiple all-nighters to get this project finished, and he needs some beauty sleep. So, he wants you
to write the last part of his code, a `sentencify` function, which takes the output that the machine gives, and formats
it into proper English orthography.

Your function should:

1. Capitalise the first letter of the first word.
2. Add a period (`.`) to the end of the sentence.
3. Join the words into a complete string, with spaces.
4. Do _no other manipulation_ on the words.

Here are a few examples of what your function should do:

Input

Output

`["i", "am", "an", "AI"]`

`"I am an AI."`

`["FIELDS","of","CORN","are","to","be","sown"]`

`"FIELDS of CORN are to be sown."`

`["i'm","afraid","I","can't","let","you","do","that"]`

`"I'm afraid I can't let you do that."`

```js
function sentencify(words) {
  let sentence = words.join(' ')
  return sentence[0].toUpperCase() + sentence.slice(1) + '.'
}
