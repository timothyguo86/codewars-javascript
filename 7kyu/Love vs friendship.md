# [Love vs friendship](https://www.codewars.com/kata/59706036f6e5d1e22d000016/)

If ã€€`a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 ... z = 26`

Then `l + o + v + e = 54`

and `f + r + i + e + n + d + s + h + i + p = 108`

So `friendship` is twice as strong as `love` :-)

Your task is to write a function which calculates the value of a word based off the sum of the alphabet positions of its characters.

The input will always be made of only lowercase letters and will never be empty.
