# [Coding Meetup #11 - Higher-Order Functions Series - Find the average age](https://www.codewars.com/kata/582ba36cc1901399a70005fc)

You will be given a sequence of objects representing data about developers who have signed up to attend the next coding
meetup that you are organising.

Given the following input array:

    var list1 = [
      { firstName: 'Maria', lastName: 'Y.', country: 'Cyprus', continent: 'Europe', age: 30, language: 'Java' },
      { firstName: 'Victoria', lastName: 'T.', country: 'Puerto Rico', continent: 'Americas', age: 70, language: 'Python' },
    ];

write a function that returns the average age of developers (rounded to the nearest integer). In the example above your
function should return `50` (number).

Notes:

- The input array will always be valid and formatted as in the example above.
- Age is represented by a number which can be any positive integer.

This kata is part of the **Coding Meetup** series which includes a number of short and easy to follow katas which have
been designed to allow mastering the use of higher-order functions. In JavaScript this includes methods like:
`forEach, filter, map, reduce, some, every, find, findIndex`. Other approaches to solving the katas are of course
possible.

Here is the full list of the katas in the **Coding Meetup** series:

```js
function getAverageAge(list) {
  return Math.round(
    list.reduce((acc, dev) => (acc = acc + dev.age), 0) / list.length,
  );
}
```
