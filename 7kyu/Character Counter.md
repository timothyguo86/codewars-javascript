# [Character Counter](https://www.codewars.com/kata/56786a687e9a88d1cf00005d)

You are going to be given a word. Your job will be to make sure that each character in that word has the exact same
number of occurrences. You will return `true` if it is valid, or `false` if it is not.

For this kata, capitals are considered the same as lowercase letters. Therefore: `"A" == "a"`

The input is a string (with no spaces) containing `[a-z],[A-Z],[0-9]` and common symbols. The length will be
`0 < length < 100`.

## Examples

- `"abcabc"` is a valid word because `"a"` appears twice, `"b"` appears twice, and`"c"` appears twice.
- `"abcabcd"` is **NOT** a valid word because `"a"` appears twice, `"b"` appears twice, `"c"` appears twice, but `"d"`
  only appears once!
- `"123abc!"` is a valid word because all of the characters only appear once in the word.

```js
function validateWord(s) {
  let charMap = {};
  s.toLowerCase()
    .split("")
    .forEach((x) => {
      charMap[x] ? (charMap[x] = charMap[x] + 1) : (charMap[x] = 1);
    });

  let wordKeys = Object.keys(charMap);
  return wordKeys.every((key) => charMap[key] === charMap[wordKeys[0]]);
}
```
