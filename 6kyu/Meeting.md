# [Meeting](https://www.codewars.com/kata/59df2f8f08c6cec835000012)

John has invited some friends. His list is:

```
s = "Fred:Corwill;Wilfred:Corwill;Barney:Tornbull;Betty:Tornbull;Bjon:Tornbull;Raphael:Corwill;Alfred:Corwill";
```

Could you make a program that

- makes this string uppercase
- gives it sorted in alphabetical order by last name.

When the last names are the same, sort them by first name. Last name and first name of a guest come in the result between parentheses separated by a comma.

So the result of function `meeting(s)` will be:

```
"(CORWILL, ALFRED)(CORWILL, FRED)(CORWILL, RAPHAEL)(CORWILL, WILFRED)(TORNBULL, BARNEY)(TORNBULL, BETTY)(TORNBULL, BJON)"
```

It can happen that in two distinct families with the same family name two people have the same first name too.

#### Notes

- You can see another examples in the "Sample tests".

```js
function meeting(s) {
  const names = s
    .toUpperCase()
    .split(';')
    .map(name => name.split(':'))
    .map(([firstName, lastName]) => [lastName, firstName])

  const sortedNames = names.sort((a, b) => {
    if (a[0] === b[0]) return a[1].localeCompare(b[1])

    return a[0].localeCompare(b[0])
  })

  return sortedNames
    .map(([firstName, lastName]) => {
      return `(${firstName}, ${lastName})`
    })
    .join('')
}
```
